## 2. NLP Tools and Libraries
- **2.1 Python Libraries for NLP**  
  - NLTK  
  - spaCy  
  - TextBlob
- **2.2 Installation Guide**  
  - `pip install nltk spacy textblob`  
  - `python -m textblob.download_corpora`

## 3. Text Processing
- **3.1 Tokenization (Word and Sentence)**
- **3.2 Stemming vs. Lemmatization**
- **3.3 Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**

- **3.5 Removing Stopwords**

## 4. Text Representation and Embeddings
- **4.1 Traditional Text Representations**  
  - Bag of Words (BoW)  
  - TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)  
- **4.2 Word Embeddings**  
  - Word2Vec (CBoW & Skip-Gram)

- **7.2 Transformer Models**  
  - BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers)  
  - GPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer)  
  - T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)  
- **7.3 Fine-Tuning BERT for NLP Tasks**  
- **7.4 Tools:** Hugging Face, TensorFlow, PyTorch

## 8. Speech and Audio Processing
- **8.1 Speech-to-Text**
- **8.2 Text-to-Speech**
- **8.3 Deep Learning Models for Audio Processing**  
  - WaveNet  
  - Tacotron  
  - Wav2Vec

## 9. Machine Learning for NLP
- **9.1 Text Classification**  
  - NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier  
  - SVM, Random Forest, and Linear Regression
- **9.2 Sentiment Analysis**  
  - Classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral  
  - Training a model for product reviews or tweets
- **9.3 Project: Spam Detection Alarm**

## 10. Roadmap & Future Steps
As I progress in learning, I plan to:
- Implement NLP tasks using various models
- Share completed projects and code snippets here
- Contribute to NLP open-source projects and share insights
