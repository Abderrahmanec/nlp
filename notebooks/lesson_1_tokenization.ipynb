# Tokenization code and explanation

Tokenization is one of the foundational steps in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It involves breaking down text into smaller units, which could be words, sentences, or other meaningful components. In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to perform tokenization using the `nltk` library.

### What is Tokenization?

Tokenization is the process of splitting a string of text into smaller components, typically:

1. **Word Tokenization**: Splits the text into individual words.
2. **Sentence Tokenization**: Splits the text into individual sentences.

By breaking text into tokens, we can then analyze the structure of the text and perform further NLP tasks.

### Tokenization Process using NLTK

We'll be using the `nltk` library for this task. Let's start by importing necessary libraries and downloading required resources.

---

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize

# Download necessary resources for tokenization
nltk.download('punkt')
