    "# Lesson 4: Mastering NLP â€“ Text Processing, Translation, and Word Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will explore several advanced tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that are crucial for understanding and processing text data. We will focus on the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Translation**: How to translate text between different languages.\n",
    "- **Word Frequency Analysis**: Understanding the frequency of words in a corpus and how to visualize this data.\n",
    "- **Language Detection**: Automatically detecting the language of a given text.\n",
    "- **Spell Correction**: Correcting misspelled words using NLP models.\n",
    "- **N-Grams**: Identifying and analyzing n-grams to understand word patterns in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you'll have a good understanding of these important NLP tasks and how to implement them in Python.\n",

    "## Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine translation can automatically translate text from one language to another. In this section, we will use the `googletrans` library to demonstrate how text can be translated between languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Code: Translate Text from English to French\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from googletrans import Translator\n",
    "translator = Translator()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Translate from English to French\n",
    "translation = translator.translate(\"Hello, how are you?\", src='en', dest='fr')\n",
    "print(\"Translated Text:\", translation.text)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Language Detection\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Language detection is a technique used to determine the language in which a given text is written. In this lesson, we will use the **`langdetect`** library to detect the language of a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "from langdetect import detect\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example text\n",
    "text = \"This is a simple sentence.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Detect the language\n",
    "language = detect(text)\n",
    "print(f\"The language is: {language}\")"
