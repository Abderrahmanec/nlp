' Main Data Flow
User -> DataCollection : 1. Provide text data
DataCollection -> DataPreprocessing : 2. Raw data
DataPreprocessing -> FeatureRep : 3. Cleaned text
FeatureRep -> NNModel : 4. Feature vectors
NNModel -> Training : 5. Train model
Training -> NNModel : 6. Updated weights
NNModel -> Infer : 9. Deploy model
Infer -> User : 10. Get predictions

' Enhanced Feedback Loop
NNModel -> Eval : 7. Evaluate
Eval -[#bold,#red]-> NNModel : 8. Feedback\n(metrics & improvements)
note on link #red: Accuracy\nPrecision\nRecall\nF1 Score
